            <h3>🍬 Emergency Water & Food</h3>
            <br>
            <p>During emergencies, having food and water within reach is crucial because not only does it sustain our energy and hydration, but also prevents the trouble of looking for it. Additionally, it is advised that you pack food and water that will last 3 days and is easy to consume, such as canned goods.</p>
